	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<h2>I am a dancer and aspiring dance educator currently in her 4th year pursing a BA/MA in Dance Education at <a href= "https://www.hunterdances.com/">Hunter College</a>
I has been coding off and on since high school and found an interest in web design. I'm interested in pursing web design to be able to create my own websites 
that function for the needs of professional artists in different settings. I also like taking candid pictures with my digital camera.</h2> 
	<h2>My goals for this course are to increase my skills in HTML and CSS and have a deeper understanding of how web design impacts user experience.</h2>
